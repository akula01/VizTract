Social networking platforms connect people from all around the world. Because of their user-friendliness and easy accessibility, their traffic is increasing drastically. Such active participation has caught the attention of many research groups focused on understanding human behavior to study the dynamics of these social networks. It is mainly due to either the large size of the data involved or the ineffective use of visualization strategies. We develop VizTract to ease the visual perception of complex social networks. VizTract is a two-level graph abstraction visualization tool that is designed to visualize both hierarchical and adjacency information in a tree structure.
